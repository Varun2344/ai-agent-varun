## üéØ Problem Statement
In a competitive market, product managers need to stay constantly updated on competitor activities. Manually checking multiple websites, changelogs, and pricing pages is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human error. Subtle but important changes in product messaging, features, or pricing can easily be missed, putting a team at a strategic disadvantage.

## ‚ú® Our Solution
This agent automates the entire monitoring and analysis process. It acts as a tireless analyst that runs in the background, providing a comprehensive daily digest of all competitor movements.

The agent's workflow:
1.  **Monitor:** It periodically checks a configurable list of competitor URLs (homepages, pricing, release notes).
2.  **Detect:** It intelligently finds changes by comparing the current page content to a previously saved snapshot using a diffing algorithm.
3.  **Analyze & Summarize:** Any detected change is sent to a local Large Language Model (LLM) which acts as a product analyst. The AI categorizes the change (e.g., "Pricing Change," "Product Update") and writes a concise summary of its impact.
4.  **Deliver:** It compiles all findings into a single, consolidated "Daily Digest" and delivers it to a designated Slack channel in a professional, easy-to-read format.

## üî• Features
- **Consolidated Daily Digest:** Get one clean report for each competitor instead of scattered alerts.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses local LLMs (e.g., `phi3`) via Ollama for private, cost-free, and intelligent summarization.
- **Change Categorization:** Automatically tags updates as Pricing, Marketing, Product Update, etc.
- **Slack Integration:** Delivers beautifully formatted reports directly to your team's workspace using Slack's Block Kit.
- **Interactive UI:** A simple Gradio interface to run the agent manually and view the history of all detected changes.
- **Configurable Targets:** Easily change which companies and pages to monitor by editing a simple `competitors.json` file.
